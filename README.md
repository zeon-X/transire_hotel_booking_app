# transire_hotel_booking_app

Welcome to the Transire repository for Miles Home, a room booking app built using Android Studio and Firebase. Our app provides a seamless experience for customers to search and book rooms, view photos and reviews of the facilities and services, and securely make payments.

With a modern and intuitive interface, users can easily browse through the hotel's rooms and amenities, view photos of the available rooms, and read reviews from previous customers. Our app also features Firebase Authentication for secure user login and Firebase Cloud Storage to store images and data, ensuring that users' information is safe and secure.

The app is specifically designed for Miles Home, a Philippines based hotel, and is tailored to their unique needs and requirements. Our team has worked closely with Miles Home to create an app that meets their specific needs and exceeds the expectations of their customers.

Whether you're a traveler looking to book your next stay or a hotel owner looking to expand your business, Transire for Miles Home is the perfect solution for you. Feel free to browse our code, contribute to the project, and join us in building the future of room booking apps.
